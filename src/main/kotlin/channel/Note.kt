/**

/**
 *      Channel() looks like a constructorâ€¦ but Channel is an interface,

/**
 *      There is a third type of buffered channel [ConflatedChannel],
 *      based on the idea that it's fine if elements that
 *      were emitted are lost. This means that this type of
 *      channel has a buffer of only one element,
 *      and whenever a new element is sent,
 *      the previous one will be lost.
 *      This also means that the sender will never be suspended.
