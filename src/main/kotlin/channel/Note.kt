/**
 *      [Channels] allow concurrent code to communicate with each other

/**
 *      Channel() looks like a constructorâ€¦ but Channel is an interface,
 *      not a class. So, Channel() is actually a top-level factory
 *      function that creates Channel objects of a particular type,
 *      based on its parameter.

/**
 *      There is a third type of buffered channel [ConflatedChannel],
 *      based on the idea that it's fine if elements that
 *      were emitted are lost. This means that this type of
 *      channel has a buffer of only one element,
 *      and whenever a new element is sent,
 *      the previous one will be lost.
 *      This also means that the sender will never be suspended.

/**
 *      poll() is a regular (non-suspend) function that takes an
 *      object out of the channel if there is one, returning null otherwise

/**
 *      Conversion to flow
 *      There are two extension functions for ReceiveChannel that wrap it in a Flow:
 *      receiveAsFlow() and consumeAsFlow(). Both give you a Flow and you can use
 *      normal Flow operators to process the items sent on the Channel.
 *      The difference is that the Flow returned by consumeAsFlow() can only be collected
 *      once (after which the channel is closed), whereas the Flow returned by
 *      receiveAsFlow() can be collected multiple times.
